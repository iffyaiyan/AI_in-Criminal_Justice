# Ethics4NextGen AI Hackathon

## AI_in_Criminal_Justice

### Problem Statement
- The risk assessment tool that judges
use to inform their decision is unfair.

- What do judges need to see to quickly
change their minds concerning the
COMPAS score?

### Solution
- Main functionality of our solution: To show the discrepancy of the
COMPAS score between the different races
- Offer the judges a Normalised score â€“ showing how the real score
should have been compared to the COMPAS score and how the
individual should have been treated differently to ensure fairness

##### Aim:
To make it as easy as possible for the judge to see the information of how
an individual should have been judged
